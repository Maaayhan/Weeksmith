# A-1 Kanban Repo Scaffolding

## Objective
Set up the repository-backed Kanban system, templates, and initial documentation required by the PRD to support all future work tracking.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create `/kanban/` directory structure with `board.md`, `coverage.md`, `daily.md`, `issues/`, `templates/`, and `artifacts/`.
- [ ] Add issue, PR, and test report templates with mandated fields.
- [ ] Seed backlog issues A-1 … A-14 with acceptance criteria and test cases.
- [ ] Initialize `board.md` with the seven Kanban columns and backlog items under **Backlog**.
- [ ] Populate `coverage.md` mapping PRD sections to work items and initial statuses.

## Developer
- Assignee: gpt-5-codex

## Estimated Complexity
- S

## Acceptance Criteria
- `/kanban/` directory contains templates (`issue.md`, `pr.md`, `test-report.md`), `board.md`, `coverage.md`, `daily.md`, and seeded issue files A-1…A-14 reflecting PRD requirements. (PRD §18.1.3)
- `board.md` lists Kanban columns (**Backlog**, **To Do**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, **Testing / QA**, **Blocked**, **Done**) with backlog items populated. (PRD §18.1.1)
- `coverage.md` documents PRD sections with status (Not Started/In Progress/etc.) and links to relevant issues. (PRD §0 Golden Rules)
- Each issue file contains required fields: Objective, Subtasks, Developer, Complexity, Acceptance Criteria, Test Cases, Related Docs/Designs, Dependencies, Risks/Mitigations, Definition of Done, plus logging sections for design, implementation, testing, reviews, QA, and final acceptance. (PRD §18.1.3 & Golden Rules)
- Kanban assets committed to version control and ready for future updates.

## Test Cases
- Verify presence and content of `/kanban/templates/issue.md`, `/kanban/templates/pr.md`, `/kanban/templates/test-report.md` with required sections.
- Confirm `board.md` renders all seven columns and backlog issue IDs.
- Confirm each issue file includes Acceptance Criteria and Test Cases derived from PRD references.
- Confirm `coverage.md` links to issue files and indicates initial status for each major PRD section.

## Related Docs / Designs
- Source PRD Section(s): [PRD §0, §18.1.1–§18.1.5](../../PRD.md)
- Additional References:

## Dependencies
- None

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: Missing required PRD fields in templates.
  - Mitigation: Cross-check templates against §18.1.3 requirements before completion.

## Definition of Done
- All Kanban scaffolding files exist with required structure, backlog seeded, coverage documented, and changes committed via PR.
