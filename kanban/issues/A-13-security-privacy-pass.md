# A-13 Security & Privacy Pass (ASVS L2)

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive security and privacy review ensuring alignment with OWASP ASVS L2, data minimization, audit logging, and user rights.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Map PRD requirements to ASVS L2 checklist and identify gaps.
- [ ] Implement remaining security controls (rate limiting, session management hardening, input validation).
- [ ] Validate audit logging, correlation IDs, and minimal sensitive data retention.
- [ ] Implement self-service data export/delete and document process.
- [ ] Perform threat modeling and document mitigations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ASVS L2 checklist completed with evidence and remediation tasks closed. (PRD §5.3, §12.1)
- Security controls include rate limiting, input validation via Zod, CSRF/session hardening, and tool access gating. (PRD §10, §12.1)
- Audit logging verified for key actions with minimal data retention and correlation IDs linking to traces. (PRD §5.4, §9)
- Data export/delete flows operational with confirmation and logging. (PRD §5.3, §12.2)
- Threat model documented including emergency unlock and AI misuse scenarios with mitigations. (PRD §15, §8.8)

## Test Cases
- Execute ASVS test cases for authentication, session management, and access control.
- Attempt privilege escalation and confirm RLS and auth layers block access.
- Run data export/delete flows and verify outputs and audit log entries.
- Validate rate limiting by simulating rapid API calls.
