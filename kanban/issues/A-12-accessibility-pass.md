# A-12 Accessibility Pass (WCAG 2.2 AA)

## Objective
Audit and remediate the application to achieve WCAG 2.2 AA compliance across core flows, documenting findings and fixes.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Conduct heuristic review of Vision, Plan, This Week, AI WAM, Retro pages using Nielsen-Molich checklist.
- [ ] Perform WCAG 2.2 AA evaluation (keyboard, focus order, contrast, motion, screen reader).
- [ ] Implement fixes for identified P0/P1 accessibility issues.
- [ ] Document accessibility notes for PR template and knowledge base.
- [ ] Establish automated accessibility checks where feasible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Accessibility audit covers key flows with findings categorized and tracked to resolution. (PRD §5.2, §7.6)
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance documented with evidence (contrast ratios, focus screenshots, ARIA annotations). (PRD §5.2)
- Accessibility notes added to PR template and engineering docs outlining keyboard traversal, focus order, motion preferences, and contrast strategy. (PRD Quality Gates)
- Automated checks (e.g., axe/lighthouse) integrated into CI or development workflow. (PRD §16 Test Plan)

## Test Cases
- Execute keyboard-only walkthrough for each major page ensuring focus indicators and logical order.
- Run screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) script verifying announcements and skip links.
- Validate prefers-reduced-motion disables non-essential animations.
- Verify color contrast meets ratios using tooling.
