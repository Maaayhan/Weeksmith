# A-2 Continuous Integration Setup

## Objective
Establish automated CI pipelines that enforce linting, type-checking, testing, and preview deploy readiness per repository conventions.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define CI workflows for lint, type-check, and unit test execution.
- [ ] Configure build/preview checks aligned with Next.js deployment targets.
- [ ] Ensure CI outputs surface Conventional Commit adherence warnings if needed.
- [ ] Document CI commands in repository docs and Kanban issue logs.

## Developer
- Assignee: gpt-5-codex

## Estimated Complexity
- M

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI pipeline runs on pull requests and verifies linting, TypeScript type-checking, and automated tests. (PRD §11, §16 C)
- Pipeline prepares or triggers preview deployments consistent with Vercel hosting strategy. (PRD §11)
- Workflow artifacts and status are documented, with failure handling guidelines matching quality gates. (PRD §4 Quality Gates)
- CI configuration stored in repo and referenced in PR template checklist. (PRD §13, §18.1.5)

## Test Cases
- Trigger CI via sample PR to observe lint/type/test jobs succeeding.
- Validate preview build step generates deploy artifact or triggers provider build.
- Confirm PR checklist reflects CI status.

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: CI steps diverge from local scripts leading to drift.
  - Mitigation: Align commands with package scripts and document in README/issue.

## Definition of Done
- CI workflows committed, validated via test run, and documented in PR and issue notes.
