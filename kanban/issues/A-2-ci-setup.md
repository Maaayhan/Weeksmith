# A-2 Continuous Integration Setup

## Objective
Establish automated CI pipelines that enforce linting, type-checking, testing, and preview deploy readiness per repository conventions.

## Subtasks
- [x] Define CI workflows for lint, type-check, and unit test execution.
- [x] Configure build/preview checks aligned with Next.js deployment targets.
- [x] Ensure CI outputs surface Conventional Commit adherence warnings if needed.
- [x] Document CI commands in repository docs and Kanban issue logs.

## Developer
- Assignee: gpt-5-codex

## Estimated Complexity
- M

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI pipeline runs on pull requests and verifies linting, TypeScript type-checking, and automated tests. (PRD §11, §16 C)
- Pipeline prepares or triggers preview deployments consistent with Vercel hosting strategy. (PRD §11)
- Workflow artifacts and status are documented, with failure handling guidelines matching quality gates. (PRD §4 Quality Gates)
- CI configuration stored in repo and referenced in PR template checklist. (PRD §13, §18.1.5)

## Test Cases
- Trigger CI via sample PR to observe lint/type/test jobs succeeding.
- Validate preview build step generates deploy artifact or triggers provider build.
- Confirm PR checklist reflects CI status.

## Dependencies
- [A-1-kanban-scaffolding](A-1-kanban-scaffolding.md)

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: CI steps diverge from local scripts leading to drift.
  - Mitigation: Align commands with package scripts and document in README/issue.

## Definition of Done
- CI workflows committed, validated via test run, and documented in PR and issue notes.

---

## Design Notes & Decisions
- CI jobs auto-detect pnpm/yarn/npm via lockfiles and install dependencies accordingly to avoid drift as tooling matures.
- Build, lint, typecheck, and test jobs skip when `package.json` is missing, preserving green CI until scaffolding lands while still enforcing script presence afterward.
- Conventional Commit validation leverages `npx` with pinned versions so no local dev dependency is required.

## Implementation Log
- UTC 2025-10-04 12:26  branch=feature/A-2-ci-setup
  Action: Created feature branch and moved task to In Progress per workflow.
  Result: OK
- UTC 2025-10-04 12:30
  Action: Authored CI workflow with lint/typecheck/test/build jobs plus commitlint enforcement; documented procedures in docs/ci.md.
  Expected: Workflow definitions align with PRD quality gates and skip gracefully before app scaffolding.
  Result: OK
- UTC 2025-10-04 12:33
  Action: Opened PR `[A-2] Set up CI pipelines` and updated issue/board logs for review hand-off.
  Result: OK

## Commands Executed
- `git checkout -b feature/A-2-ci-setup`
- `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
- `cat <<'EOF' > .github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `cat <<'EOF' > commitlint.config.cjs`
- `mkdir -p docs`
- `cat <<'EOF' > docs/ci.md`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions pipeline [A-2]"`
- `make_pr --title "[A-2] Set up CI pipelines" --body ...`

## Test Evidence
- Pending — workflow runs once application scaffolding introduces package scripts.
