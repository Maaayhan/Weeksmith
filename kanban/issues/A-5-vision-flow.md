# A-5 Vision Flow

## Objective
Deliver the Vision experience covering guided prompts, multi-level vision capture (daily/weekly/year/life), visualization, and alignment cues.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design guided questionnaire UI with four levels and preview.
- [ ] Implement storage and retrieval via `vision` table and related APIs.
- [ ] Visualize daily/weekly vision board with tags and time blocks.
- [ ] Surface alignment chips in Plan/This Week when discrepancies arise.
- [ ] Author onboarding copy aligned with Zach methodology.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can input and save Daily/Weekly/Year/Life vision with guided prompts and undo/cancel controls. (PRD §4.1, §7.1)
- Vision board renders visual summary with tags and time block overview. (PRD §4.1 V-2)
- Alignment detection surfaces chips in Plan/This Week for misaligned tasks. (PRD §4.1 V-3)
- WCAG 2.2 AA considerations documented for this flow. (PRD §5.2, §7.6)
- Vision data persists via API/Server Actions with Zod validation and audit logging. (PRD §10, §9)

## Test Cases
- Create and edit each vision level, verify saved data persists across sessions.
- Confirm undo/cancel reverts unsaved changes.
- Add tasks misaligned with vision and verify chip warnings appear.
- Accessibility test: keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader labels.

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: Alignment detection may produce false positives.
  - Mitigation: Allow user override and document heuristics.

## Definition of Done
- Vision UI/API complete with tests, accessibility verification, and documentation.
