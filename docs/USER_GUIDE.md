## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup

1. **Sign In**
   - Visit the Weeksmith homepage
   - Click "Continue with email"
   - Enter your email address
   - Check your email for a magic link (expires in 5 minutes)
   - Click the link to sign in

2. **Complete Your Vision** (Recommended First Step)
   - Navigate to **Vision** page
   - Fill out your Daily, Weekly, Year, and Life vision statements
   - Add tags (up to 12) that represent your core values/focus areas
   - Click "Save vision"

3. **Create Your 12-Week Plan**
   - Go to **Plan** page
   - Define exactly **1 Personal Goal** and **1 Professional Goal**
   - Set weekly quotas for each goal (input-based actions only)
   - Remember: Weeks 1-6 are adjustable, Weeks 7-12 are locked

## Core Concepts

### The 1+1 Rule
- You can only have **one personal goal** and **one professional goal** per 12-week cycle
- This constraint helps maintain focus and prevents overwhelm

### Input-Only Actions
- All goals must be **input-based** (actions you fully control)
- ❌ Bad: "Gain 500 followers" (output/KPI)
- ✅ Good: "Write 6 video scripts" (input/action)

### The 6/6 Lock Rule
- **Weeks 1-6**: Adjustable - you can modify quotas and tasks
- **Weeks 7-12**: Locked - quotas cannot be changed (only execution tracking)

### The 85% Rule
- Target **85% completion rate** each week (the optimal learning zone)
- Below 85%: Goals were too hard — reduce scope or frequency to reach 85%
- 85-90%: Optimal learning zone — you're learning effectively without getting lost
- Above 90%: Goals were too easy — add challenge or volume to push back into 85-90%
- This percentage helps you calibrate weekly goals over time

## Features

### 1. Vision Navigator (`/vision`)

**Purpose**: Define your ideal day, week, year, and life vision.

**How to Use**:
- Answer guided prompts for each time horizon
- Add tags that represent your values/focus areas
- Review alignment chips that show if your plan items match your vision tags

**Tips**:
- Be specific and actionable
- Use tags consistently across vision and plan items
- Review and update your vision periodically

### 2. 12-Week Plan Builder (`/plan`)

**Purpose**: Create your structured 12-week execution plan.

**How to Use**:
1. Enter your Personal Goal (e.g., "Build consistent exercise habit")
2. Enter your Professional Goal (e.g., "Ship 12 articles")
3. For each week (1-12), set:
   - Task description (input-based)
   - Quantity (how many)
   - Unit (sessions, blocks, hours, etc.)
   - Goal type (Personal or Professional)
4. Click "Save 12-week plan"

**Important Rules**:
- Only 1 Personal + 1 Professional goal allowed
- All tasks must be input-based (no KPIs)
- Weeks 7-12 become locked after saving
- Use "Copy to Week" to duplicate successful patterns

**Example Input-Based Tasks**:
- ✅ "Write 3 article drafts"
- ✅ "Complete 4 gym sessions"
- ✅ "Schedule 2 networking calls"
- ❌ "Get 1000 views" (output/KPI)
- ❌ "Earn $5000" (output/KPI)

### 3. This Week Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

**Purpose**: Track your weekly execution and progress.

**Features**:

#### Workflow Modes
- **Time Blocking**: Assign specific start times and durations to tasks
- **Priority Queue**: Kanban-style board for flexible task management
- Switch between modes anytime (doesn't affect quotas)

#### Completion Gauge
- Visual indicator showing your completion percentage
- Color-coded zones:
  - 🔴 Below 85%: "Goals were too hard — reduce scope or frequency"
  - 🟢 85-90%: "Optimal learning zone — 85% is the target"
  - 🟡 Above 90%: "Goals were too easy — add challenge or volume"

#### Progress Tracking
- Update task status: Planned → In Progress → Completed → Skipped
- Record completed quantities
- Add quick notes and obstacles

#### Obstacle Logging
- Categorize obstacles: Time, Energy, Environment, Skill
- Notes feed into AI WAM and retrospective analysis
- Helps identify patterns and blockers

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Week 1: Setup
1. ✅ Sign in
2. ✅ Complete Vision (Daily/Weekly/Year/Life + tags)
3. ✅ Create 12-Week Plan (1+1 goals, input-based tasks)
4. ✅ Review Week 1 tasks in Dashboard

### Weeks 1-6: Execution & Adjustment
1. **Start of Week**:
   - Review weekly plan in Dashboard
   - Choose workflow mode (Time Blocking or Priority Queue)
   - Set up time blocks or prioritize tasks

2. **During Week**:
   - Update task status as you progress
   - Log completed quantities
   - Record obstacles when they occur

3. **End of Week**:
   - Review completion gauge
   - Adjust Week 1-6 quotas if needed (go back to Plan page)
   - Log any obstacles or learnings

### Weeks 7-12: Locked Execution
1. **Start of Week**:
   - Review locked weekly plan
   - Choose workflow mode
   - Note: Quotas cannot be changed (locked by design)

2. **During Week**:
   - Track execution only
   - Update status and completion
   - Log obstacles for retrospective

3. **End of Week**:
   - Review completion gauge
   - Continue tracking (no quota changes allowed)

### After Week 12: Retrospective
- Review 12-week completion distribution
- Analyze obstacles and wins
- Generate next cycle draft
- Take 2-week break (recommended)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Vision
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "be healthy", describe "wake at 5:30am, gym 4x/week, meal prep Sundays"
- **Use Tags Wisely**: Tags connect your vision to your plan - use consistent keywords
- **Review Regularly**: Update your vision as you learn and grow

### Planning
- **Start Small**: Better to complete 80% of a small plan than 40% of an ambitious one
- **Input Focus**: Always ask "What can I control?" when writing tasks
- **Use If-Then Format**: "If [trigger], then I will [action]" helps clarify inputs
- **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group related inputs together for efficiency

### Execution
- **Check Dashboard Daily**: Regular updates keep you accountable
- **Log Obstacles Immediately**: Don't wait - capture friction when it happens
- **Aim for 85%**: This is the optimal learning zone, not 100%
- **Use Time Blocking for Structure**: If you need structure, use time blocks
- **Use Priority Queue for Flexibility**: If you need flexibility, use the queue

### Lock Period (Weeks 7-12)
- **Trust the Process**: The lock exists to prevent second-guessing
- **Focus on Execution**: Shift from planning to doing
- **Track Everything**: Detailed logs help with retrospective

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't save my plan"
- **Check**: Do you have exactly 1 Personal and 1 Professional goal?
- **Check**: Are all tasks input-based (no KPIs like followers, revenue)?
- **Check**: Are you trying to modify Weeks 7-12? (They're locked)

### "My completion is below 85%"
- **Action**: Goals were too hard — reduce quantity or frequency for next week
- **Action**: Break tasks into smaller chunks
- **Action**: Review obstacles to identify blockers
- **Goal**: Adjust to reach 85% completion rate

### "My completion is above 90%"
- **Action**: Goals were too easy — consider adding challenge or volume
- **Action**: This might indicate you're ready for more
- **Goal**: Push back into the 85-90% band

### "I can't change Week 7+ quotas"
- **This is by design**: Weeks 7-12 are locked to prevent second-guessing
- **Solution**: Focus on execution tracking only
- **Note**: Emergency unlock requires support assistance (documented in security baseline)

### "Vision alignment chips keep appearing"
- **Action**: Add matching tags to your plan items
- **Action**: Or dismiss chips if you intentionally want different focus
- **Tip**: Tags connect vision to execution - use them consistently

### "I forgot my password"
- **No password needed**: Weeksmith uses magic links
- **Action**: Just request a new magic link from the login page
